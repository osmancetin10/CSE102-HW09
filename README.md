# CSE102-HW09
Homework 9 of CSE102 class at Gebze Technical University

In this homework, I implemented a game. A botanist looking for a quite rare flower by walking randomly in a forest. He/she is sure about that the rare flower in that forest certainly. He must find the rare flower before his water runs out. Otherwise, he faints in the forest.
